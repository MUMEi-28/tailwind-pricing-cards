# Pricing Cards with Tailwind CSS
This repository contains a simple and clean implementation of pricing cards created using Tailwind CSS. This project serves as a practice to test and improve my knowledge of Tailwind CSS, focusing on layout, design, and responsiveness.

## Features
-Responsive Design: The pricing cards are fully responsive and adapt to various screen sizes.

-Modern UI: Clean and minimalist design using Tailwind CSS.

-Customizable: Easy to tweak and adjust the design.

## Technologies Used
-HTML: For the structure of the page.
-Tailwind CSS: For styling and layout.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/MUMEi-28/tailwind-pricing-cards.git`

2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd tailwind-pricing-cards`

3. Install Tailwind CSS (if you want to make changes or explore further):
   - Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
   - Install Tailwind CSS via npm: `nmp install -D tailwindcss`
   - Initialize the Tailwind configuration file: `npx tailwindcss init`
   - Use the generated `tailwind.config.js` file to customize your Tailwind CSS setup.
  
4. If you make changes to the Tailwind CSS styles, compile them:
  - Run this on terminal `npx tailwind -i ./src/input.css -o ./build/css/style.css --watch`

5. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the pricing cards:
  - If you have live server installed in your VS Code, use it to preview the project for better results.


## Goals
- Practice using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- Build reusable and responsive components.
- Experiment with customizing Tailwind CSS styles.
